# Neil Gandhi Portfolio

## Description

This project is the updated Career Portfolio webpage for the work done in this course. This portfolio highlights the skills learned in this bootcamp as well as provides examples of work to prospective employers/visitors.

This page will utilize all the skills learned in the course to showcase my capabilities and will be a page that can be linked to containing any and all information needed to become employer-competitive.

## Installation

In order to view this application, please visit the main page [https://ntch2000.github.io/react-portfolio/#/](https://ntch2000.github.io/react-portfolio/#/). The links in the top navbar allow for navigation to the other pages of the application (portfolio.html and contact.html).

To see the code base for this page, visit my github page [https://github.com/ntch2000/react-portfolio](https://github.com/ntch2000/react-portfolio). The code can be viewed directly in the github repository or downloaded and viewed in any text editor.

## Development Notes

This is the newly updated career portfolio page, with personalized information as well as new styling. This page will continue to evolve as new technologies are learned and new frameworks integrated to provide the best portfolio page possible with the end result to obtain a new career in web-development.

This version of my portfolio utilizes [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) to render the front-end. Each major section of the page (Header, Footer, Projects) are rendered as components that are then added to each container/page (Home, About, Portfolio, Contact). This allows for an easy way to make changes to single component and publish those changes across all pages, making the code very modular.

To navigate across the portfolio, React Router was used, allowing for simple and efficient routing of pages.

## Usage

## Credits

The resources used to help develop this application are as follows.

- The [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework was used to create the majority of the page and css styles. This allowed for proper layout and responsiveness required for the page.
- I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons for the contact page as well as the skills section.
